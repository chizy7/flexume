# Contributing to Flexume

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Flexume! We welcome contributions from everyone.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible using our [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml).

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues using our [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml).

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues](https://github.com/flexume/flexume/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/flexume/flexume/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request using our [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Development Process

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flexume.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Run the test suite to ensure everything passes
4. Run the linter to ensure code style compliance
5. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: add user authentication system`

### Testing

- Write tests for new code
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include both unit and integration tests where appropriate

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
